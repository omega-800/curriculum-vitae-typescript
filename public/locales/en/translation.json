  "art_origami_description": "In my childhood i was fascinated by making origami. to this day i still fold all kinds of kusudamas and paper cranes. origami is an art form that challenges my creativity and patience while calming me down. it's amazing how something so beautiful can come out of a simple piece of paper. the variety of possible characters and models is endless and there is always something new to discover and learn. making origami is a wonderful way for me to spend my free time and improve my skills at the same time.",
  "art_drawings_title": "Drawings",
  "art_drawings_description": "Drawing is one of my favorite hobbies because it is very meditative and i can let my creativity unfold. all i need is a pen and a piece of paper and i can immerse myself in my own world and concentrate fully on my art. there are no rules or guidelines, i can just let my imagination run wild and experiment. this often results in unexpected results that surprise and inspire me. for me, the beauty of drawing lies in the fact that it is a never-ending field of learning. there are always new techniques, styles and materials to discover and try out, which constantly challenges and motivates me to develop further. although i still have a lot to learn, i enjoy every moment of drawing and am grateful for the opportunity to express my own world in this way.",
  "art_spraypaint_title": "Graffiti",
  "art_spraypaint_description": "Since trying this medium, i have started spraying in legal locations every summer, as this unique technique allows me to do many new things. when spraying, i can turn my ideas into great works of art. the freedom i feel when spraying is indescribable and the colors i can use are so diverse that i'm always amazed. i also love spraying outdoors in nature and being inspired by the surroundings. it's a great feeling to share my art with other people and to see them enjoying or discussing my work. while spraying is often considered illegal, there are many legal places i can go to have fun and hone my skills. i am grateful for this opportunity to live out my passion and express myself in a creative way.",
  "art_other_title": "More artworks",
  "art_other_description": "Aside from the above categories, i enjoy exploring other areas of art such as woodwork and mosaics. woodwork fascinates me because of the natural beauty of the material and the variety of possibilities it offers. i love to shape and work wood to create unique furniture, sculptures and other works of art. the sanding, carving and polishing of the wood is almost meditative for me and i enjoy the challenges that this work brings.\ni am also fascinated by mosaics. i am fascinated by the myriad of small pieces that are put together to form a larger picture. i love using different materials like ceramic, glass or stone to create colorful and expressive artworks. when laying a mosaic i can lose myself in my own world for hours and get lost in the small details of my work. it's amazing how the many small parts finally merge into a harmonious whole and tell a story. these creative processes are a source of inspiration and expression for me, which mean a lot to me in my life.",
